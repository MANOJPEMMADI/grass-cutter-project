For your smart grass cutter project using an Arduino, motor driver, ultrasonic sensor, and servo motor, here's the wiring breakdown based on the code:

1. Arduino Pins
Left Motor (connected to the L298N motor driver):
LeftMotorForward (pin 7) → IN1 of L298N
LeftMotorBackward (pin 6) → IN2 of L298N
Right Motor (connected to the L298N motor driver):
RightMotorForward (pin 5) → IN3 of L298N
RightMotorBackward (pin 4) → IN4 of L298N
Servo Motor:
Control signal → Pin 10 of Arduino
Ultrasonic Sensor:
Trig → Analog Pin A1 of Arduino
Echo → Analog Pin A2 of Arduino
2. Motor Driver (L298N) Connections:
Power (12V, GND, 5V):
Connect the motor power supply to the +12V and GND pins of the L298N motor driver.
Connect the 5V pin from L298N to the Arduino's 5V pin.
Motor Output:
Connect the left motor to the OUT1 and OUT2 pins.
Connect the right motor to the OUT3 and OUT4 pins.
3. Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04):
Trig Pin: Connect the Trig pin of the ultrasonic sensor to analog pin A1.
Echo Pin: Connect the Echo pin of the ultrasonic sensor to analog pin A2.
VCC: Connect VCC to the 5V pin of the Arduino.
GND: Connect GND to the GND pin of the Arduino.
4. Servo Motor (SG90 or similar):
Control Pin: Connect the control pin of the servo motor to digital pin 10 on the Arduino.
VCC: Connect VCC to the 5V pin of the Arduino.
GND: Connect GND to the GND pin of the Arduino.
5. Power Supply:
Ensure your power source is sufficient to drive the motors and electronics (usually a 12V battery for motors and using the onboard Arduino regulator for the logic circuits).
This setup should align with the code provided and control the motors and sensors correctly for obstacle detection and motor movement in your grass cutter project.
