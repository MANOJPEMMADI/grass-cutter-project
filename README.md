## 🧠 Working Principle

The ultrasonic sensor detects any obstacle in the path. Based on the input, the Arduino Uno decides whether to move forward, stop, or turn left/right. The grass-cutting motor continuously spins during motion, trimming grass as the chassis moves autonomously over a defined area.

## 🎯 Objective

To design and implement an autonomous, eco-friendly grass cutter that reduces human effort, avoids obstacles, and works efficiently in garden environments.
